# Micro-services with Finagle

---

#Twitter evolves

**2009**: Pure Ruby-on-Rails app with MySQL; lots of memcache. Materialized timelines into memcaches. Social graph moved to a service. Delayed work through queues.

**2010**: Starting to move timelines out to its own serving system. Project godwit was started to move Twitter off ruby on rails. Work begins on shared serving infrastructure.

**2011**: Infrastructure matures; a ton of work is being put into porting the application. TFE goes online.

**2012**: TFE serves 100% of traffic all year; more and more of the API (by traffic) is being served off the new stack. Most new work happens there.

**2015**: Last "Monorail" service was decomissioned in Dec 2015. TFE is still 100% finagle service.

## About micro-services

 * allow fine-grained logic
 * allow gradual deployement
 * allow fault tolerance
 * allow scalability

---

## Disclaimer

I did not spent last 10 year researching the
micro-services frameworks, so take if for what it's worth

---

# Basic premise

Everyone should understand:

 * Fallacies of distributed computing
 * Tracing
 * Observability

---

# Ok just a recap
The fallacies are:

  * The network is reliable.
  * Latency is zero.
  * Bandwidth is infinite.
  * The network is secure.
  * Topology doesn't change.
  * There is one administrator.
  * Transport cost is zero.
  * The network is homogeneous.

---

#Finagle

A crude recap:

 * Partial failures, message passing
 * Futures, Services
 * Finagle makes it possible
 * Clients provide services, servers consume them.

Adds behavior, largely configurable: load balancing, connection pooling, retrying, timeouts, rate limiting, monitoring, stats collection.

Protocol agnostic: codecs implement wire protocols.

Manages resources.

---

# Building blocks

  * Future

    just a read-only `Promise`, or single-event read-only `Observable`

  * Service
```
type Service[Req, Rep] = Req => Future[Rep]
```

  * Filter
    ```
abstract class Filter[-ReqIn, +RepOut, +ReqOut, -ReqIn] 
  extends (ReqIn, Service[ReqOut, RepIn]) => Future[RepOut]
    ```

  * Server

    Knows about the network, protocol, et.al.

---

# Future

Almost like `java.util.concurrent.Future`. 

Promise of a future result, where result could be a value or an error.

A placeholder for for a result that is, usually, being computed concurrently
  
  * long computations
  * network call
  * reading from disk

Computations can fail:

  * connection failure
  * timeout
  * div by zero, NullPointerException & Co

Futures are how we represent concurrent execution.

---

# Future

Are a kind of container:

```
trait Future[A]
```

It can be empty, full, or failed. You can wait for it:

```
val f: Future[A]
val result = f()
```

Failures would result in exceptions, prefer using Try:

```
f.get() match {
  case Return(res) => ...
  case Throw(exc) => ...
}
```

---

# Service
  
Does not now about network. As close to function as possible.

We’ve seen how we can use futures for concurrent programming, now we’ll see how network programming fits into the picture.

What is an RPC?Dispatch a request
 * Wait a while
 * Succeeds or fails
 * It’s a function!

```
type Service[Req, Rep] = Req => Future[Rep]
```

Servers implement these, clients make use of them.

---

# Filter
  
Many common behaviors of services are agnostic to the particulars of the service; some common ones:

 * retries
 * timeouts
 * exception handling
 * stats

Filters compose over services. Conceptually, we want to alter the behavior of a service while being agnostic to what the service is.

Filter + Filter = Filter

Filter + Service = Service

---

# Filter Example

```
class AuthFilter extends Filter[Creds, Seq[Post], User, Seq[Post]] {
  def authUser(creds: Creds): Future[User] = ...
  def apply(creds: Creds, svc: Service[User, Seq[Post]]): Future[Seq[Post]] = {
    authUser andThen svc
  }

}

class PostsService extends Service[User, Seq[Post]] {
  def apply(user: User): Future[Seq[Post]] = getPosts(user)
}

val auth = AuthFilter
val serv = PostsService
Thrift.serveIface(":9090", auth andThen serv)

```

---

# Server Example

```
import com.twitter.finagle.http.{HttpMuxer, Request, Response}
import com.twitter.finagle.Http
import com.twitter.finagle.Service
import com.twitter.util.{Await, Future}
 
object HelloFinagle extends App {
 
  val hello = {
    new Service[Request, Response] {
      def apply(req: Request) = {
        val r = req.response
        r.setStatusCode(200)
        r.setContentTypeJson()
        r.setContentString("""{"hello": "world"}""")
        Future.value(r)
      }
    }
  }
 
  HttpMuxer.addRichHandler(f"/hello", hello)
  val server = Http.serve("0.0.0.0:8000", HttpMuxer)
  Await.ready(server)
}
```

---

# Twitter Server

Packed with features, production-ready server

 * Configuration flags
 * Logging
 * Shutdown hooks and commands
 * Service visibility (jvm/service stats, server info)

---

# Hola!

```
import com.twitter.finagle.{Http, Service}
import com.twitter.finagle.http.{Request, Response, Status}
import com.twitter.io.Charsets
import com.twitter.server.TwitterServer
import com.twitter.util.{Await, Future}

object BasicServer extends TwitterServer {
  val service = new Service[Request, Response] {
    def apply(request: Request) = {
      val response = Response(request.version, Status.Ok)
      response.contentString = "hola!"
      Future.value(response)
    }
  }

  def main() {
    val server = Http.serve(":8888", service)
    onExit {
      server.close()
    }
    Await.ready(server)
  }
}
```

#In practice: the good

Emphasizing declarative/data flow style programming with future combinators result in robust, modular, safe, and simple systems.

  * Most of our systems are big “Future transformers”: really only Finagle creates Promises.
  * This style of programming also encourages/enforces modularity.

It is simple to build higher level combinators.

  * eg.: generic hash-ring sharding, stats, speculative execution, custom load balancers - everything is uniform

Lots of implementor leeway.

  * Tracing, cancellation, thread-biasing pools, etc. with zero user code change

---

#In practice: the ugly

Some things don't fit so neatly: cancellation is hairy, for instance, but very important.

Clean separation is sometimes troublesome: eg. how to always retry a request on a **different** host?

Layering is never actually clean - the world is very messy.

Abstraction results in greater garbage collector pressure, but the JVM is very good.
